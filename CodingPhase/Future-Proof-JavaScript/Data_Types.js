//Data Types

// Strings
/* Strings are any type of data (numbers, letters, symbols) that are all compromised inside of a set of either single or double quotes. However, it is
good practice when choosing quote methodology to keep it consistent in your project/documents.
/*Example*/ var name = 'Joe';

// Numbers/Integers
/* Numbers are written without any sort of bracketing/holding characteristic as noted below.
/*Example*/ var number = 23

//Arrays
var array = ['Joe' 23, ['hey', 'Joe']]
/* Arrays are essentially 'lists' of data. An array can hold any time of data such as: Strings, numbers, and even other arrays. Arrays are noticed
by their use of the square brackets.*/

//Objects
var object = {
    key: 'value',
    func: function() {
        return 'hey'
    }
}
/* An object is a data type that is responsible for holding what is known as 'Keys' and 'Values. The 'Key' can essentially be the name and the 'Value'
is what you wish to assign to it. An object may hold things such as strings, numbers, booleans, and even functions.*/

//Booleans
var Booleans = true;
/* A boolean is essentially a true/false statement. Often used when comparing data.*/

//Null
var nullable = null;
/* Null means that you have created a piece of code that holds a value inside, however at this given time that value does not have a set corespondance.
This is good for using as placeholder.*/

//Undefined
var another = undefined;
/* Undefined literally means just that. It is often used to search your code and find wether or not a var is used.
