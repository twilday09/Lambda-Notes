/*If you show this screen and the Integer_Excercises.js screen, you
will notice that I actually got it wrong!! Now, I want to make something 
clear. IT IS OKAY TO BE WRONG WHEN LEARNING CODE!! Even senior developers
will admit that they are wrong too! The thing about code is you have to develop
a attention to detail, and this will take time and repition. So, hopefully, you
guys attempted the excercise on your own! If you did, then I would like
you to add comments to your repo as to what you did wrong and comment me! :D
