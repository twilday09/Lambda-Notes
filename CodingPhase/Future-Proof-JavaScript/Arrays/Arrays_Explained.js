var users = ['Matt', 'Cam', 'Barbara', 'Bryant', 'Joseph']
/* The above is an example of an array, which is a collection of data which can hold a variety of data types.
Now, unlike strings, inside an array (inside the square brackets), the character, or better known as the index,
is selected starting with 0 instead of one. 
/*Example*/
console.log(users[2]); // This will return Barbara
/* 
0 = 'Matt'
1 = 'Cam' 
2 = 'Barbara'
3 = 'Bryant'
4 = 'Joseph'
*/

/*As we said above, arrays can host a variety of data types, and below is just a quick example of that!*/
var users = ['Matt', 2, {user: 'Barbara'}, ['array', 'array2'], 'Joseph', 'Joe']
/*As we see, it is holding:
-A string called Matt
-A integer with the value of 2
-A object with a key of user and a value of Barbara
-A new array with 2 data types within that
-2 more strings with values of Joseph and Joe

/*Above was simply a taste and introduction into the use and application of Arrays. Follow us farther in the tutorial
to understand the more involed aspect of JS array features.*/
