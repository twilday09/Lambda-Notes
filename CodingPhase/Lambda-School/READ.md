# Lambda School Notes
This file will be a collective of all of my notes that I have taken while enrolled in Lambda School from start to finnish in a digital format.

## What is Lambda School?
Lambda School is a vocational-like full length code bootcamp that teaches students a wide variety of topics in either a full time or part time formant. These classes include:

* Web Development
* iOS Development
* Adroid Development
* Data Science
* UI/UX Design

## Why did I select Lambda School?
Lambda School has a unique business model that it is using to turn the tech trade on its head. Oftentimes, the general thought is that if a individual wishes to enter the tech industry, he/she must contain some sort of degree (Often the most common is Computer Science). More often than not, CS often teaches lower level languages and students are more focused on theory as opposed to actual coding. Lambda School in pertaining to Web Dev focuses heavy on going from the most basic of concepts to the most advanced and touching on all aspects of front end/back end and even UI components. The biggest selling point for many of its students is that it offers a ISA (Income Shared Agreement) as opposed to paying tuition up front. What the ISA does is that it wasves cost of tuition if accepted into the program and then allows you to complete your entire schooling, and only upon graduation of the program and receiving a salary of $50,000 or MORE do you begin repayemnt (repayment ammount depends on type of ISA selected upon enrollment).
