# Tutorial Island
This Github repo is specifically designed to cultivate 2 major criteria:

* First, I want to have a open shared space to which myself and others can access notes in a open setting so that we may all combine our knowledge and share any ideas or tidbits to even further break down tutorials to truly help those whom are fresh to the coding atmosphere. 
* Second, I wanted to create a written clean and concise log that holds notes from both free and paid resources out there and offer them as a form of study material to students/private learners who may not have the means to access these online tools or have the financial means to purchase them.

## What is the focus?
The primary focus as of today (05/23/2019) is purely on tools and resources used to develop Web Developers. Over time however, perhaps we may add more to this comprehensive guide. If you already have clean notes and wish to contribute, please email the creator at VandiTechSpot@gmail.com.

## How to navigate the log
The log is broken down into a list of folders. Each folder will have the title of the tutorial/lesson that it is covering and inside will contain a Read.md file that shows all the material covered in that lesson as well as individual markdown topic files that then go into detail on the micro topic of the general subsection.

# About the creator
My name is Joshua and currently as of todays date, I am a 24 year old full time diesel mechanic. I achieved my certificate in Automotive Repair from Universal Technical Institute in December of 2015 and since then have transitioned into the Heavy Equipment/Diesel sector and have been a tradesmen ever sense. As many people (esepecially in modern times with the boom of the tech era) can state, oten times we find that the field we perhaps thought was the right fit for us is indeed the opposite occurs however we find ourselves stuck and unable to make a transition. I recently (late 2018) decided that it was time I move on from my mechanical repair sector and transition into Development in the tech region, however I am always  thoughtful of the skills I learned these last 4-5 years such as:

* Critical thinking
* Electronic Diagnostics
* Continued development of new technologies
* How to effectively sort and manage time to better efficiency and productivity
* Working in a team and progressing from student/apprentice to journeymen to senior level mechanics
